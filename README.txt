The effect blocks use copper to operate (they are ConsumeGenerators).
Every effect block's name is the same as the effect's identifier which it shows. This means that if you like an effect simply write the name of the block showing it into your code, you don't even have to look through the code and find which effect the block uses.

For example:

You would like to make a GenericCrafter.
You find a cool effect to use as craftEffect.
The block's name which shows it is pulverizeSmall.

So you simply write in your code:
craftEffect: pulverizeSmall

Be careful with impactReactorExplosion and reactorExplosion, they are pretty h u g e.

You can use the map I made to display all the effects, it is sorted by size an shape, so it's really convenient.

I hope this mod helps someone! hunitex
